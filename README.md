# Gaze Estimation from encoding appearance and geometry information
## Group Member: 
Zeping Ren，Minzhen Yi，Yunyang Xiong

Yunyang has decribed his work in the presentation, but he did not say much about Zeping and Minzhen's work, which is related to another kind of appearance-based method. As is said in the presentation, the appearance-based methods are widely researched in the area of gaze estimation, and you can regard this part of work as a supplement to better evaluate the methods in our presentation.

Zeping and Minzhen's work are pramirily based on [Lu 2011](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6126237/) with some changes in the training methods. The dataset we used is the [MPIIGaze Dataset](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-multimodal-computing/research/gaze-based-human-computer-interaction/appearance-based-gaze-estimation-in-the-wild-mpiigaze/). Please go to the [wiki](https://github.com/ShoyiRen/CS766_ComputerVision_Project/wiki) to see details of our work. And you can also find the work in our presentation in Yunyang's webpage.
