The Canadians can advance straight to the quarter-finals in two ways. First, if they defeat <L>South Korea</L> in regulation time and <L>Switzerland</L> upsets the <L>Czech Republic</L> in any fashion, <L>Canada</L> would finish first in Group A with seven points.

The second scenario is that, even if the Czechs defeat <L>Switzerland</L>, <L>Canada</L> could finish with the best record by a non-group winner if they get a regulation win against <L>South Korea</L>.
