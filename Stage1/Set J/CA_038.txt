Meghan Agosta of <L>Ruthven</L>, <L>Ontario</L>, and Hamilton's Sarah Nurse scored in the second period for the Canadians, who are aiming for a fifth straight Olympic title.

Genevieve Lacasse of <L>Kingston</L>, <L>Ontario</L>, stopped 44 shots.

"I always expect a lot of shots against the <L>U.S.</L> and we did a great job keeping their shots to the outside," Lacasse said. "They usually get a good amount of shots, but not necessarily that many quality ones."
