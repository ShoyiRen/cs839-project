An apparent Kim Jong Un impersonator, who later only identified himself as Howard, caused quite a stir during the unified Korean team's ice hockey match against <L>Japan</L> today.
The impersonator waved a unified Korean flag in front of North Korean cheerleaders at the <L>Gangneung</L> Hockey Centre -- some of which reportedly averted their gaze or giggled.
"I was born with this face, Iâ€™ve got to live with it," Howard told Reuters, after been escorted away from the arena.
