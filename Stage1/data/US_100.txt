After clinching his nation's second gold medal of <L>PyeongChang</L> 2018, South Korea's Yun Sung-bin spoke of his pride at becoming the first Asian to win a sliding medal -- and on home ice, too.
"It is not my effort alone that got me this medal," he said. "I would like to thank all my team for helping me, encouraging me.
"It is still unbelievable that I got the gold medal. Getting the gold medal in any Olympics is a very great result but getting the gold here in my home country is a very great honor, much bigger than that."
