Fast food giant McDonald's announced in June that it would end a decades-long partnership with the International Olympic Committee.
The sponsorship was supposed to run through at least 2020, but McDonald's pulled out of the deal early.
That means American audiences won't see any Olympics-themed McDonald's television advertisements during this year's Games.
It also means the 2018 <L>Pyeongchang</L> Olympics will be the last to feature McDonald's restaurants in the Olympic Park and Village.
