"We are saying, come around and dialogue with us," said Christophe Dubi, executive director of the Olympics.

Dubi said <L>Norway</L>, <L>Austria</L> and the <L>United States</L> had also shown some interest -- if not for 2026, then for 2030.

<L>U.S.</L> Olympic officials say the nation won't bid for the 2026 Games, with <L>Los Angeles</L> hosting the Summer Olympics in 2028. <L>Salt Lake City</L>, <L>Denver</L> and <L>Reno</L>, <L>Nevada</L>, are expected to consider 2030 bids.
