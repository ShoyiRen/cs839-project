Well, that was breathless stuff at the Olympic Sliding Center, where Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt have extended Germany's lead at the top of the <L>PyeongChang</L> 2018 medal table. The duo, nicknamed "The Bayern Express," won the doubles luge gold with the very last run of the event, retaining the title they won in <L>Sochi</L>.
Four years ago, Wendl and Arlt finished a full half a second ahead of Austrian brothers Andreas and Wolfgang Linger -- the biggest ever winning margin in the luge doubles.
This time in <L>South Korea</L>, they edged Austrians Peter Penz and Georg Fischler by a mere eight hundredths of a second. It's tears of joy for fellow Germans Eggert and Benecken as they join them in third on the podium.
