In November of 2002, I married my wife and moved to <L>Canada</L>. At the time I really had no intention of competing for <L>Canada</L>, but I was training with the Canadian development team. Another year went by and I received my Canadian Permanent Residency and my Jamaican team had not yet come to <L>Calgary</L>. It was at this time I was approached by someone from Bobsleigh <L>Canada</L> and was asked to push for <L>Canada</L>. While it hadnâ€™t occurred to me before, it was becoming more and more obvious that <L>Jamaica</L> would not be competing at the next Olympics, so I agreed to slide for <L>Canada</L>.

After all, this is where I live, this is where my family is and <L>Canada</L> has been really good to me. During my first season with the Canadian team, Pierre Lueders and I won the two-man world championship. In my first couple of seasons on the team we earned medals in almost every race, and set several start records. This is where I belonged. This is where I was supposed to be.
