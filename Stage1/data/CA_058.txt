Throughout the first three games at the Olympics in <L>South Korea</L>, Rachel Homan and her team out of <L>Ottawa</L> were on the wrong side of the inch. A couple of key misses here and there had the team at 0-3, but they could have easily been 2-1 or even 3-0.

After a second extra-end loss at the Olympics (against <L>Sweden</L> and then <L>Denmark</L>) the team called a players-only meeting to talk about what needed to change. Whatever they said seems to be working.
