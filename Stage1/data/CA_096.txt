In a short tournament without clear heavyweights, a hot team can remain so while a cold one doesn't have much time to raise its temperature.

That's why Canadian men's hockey team coach Willie Desjardins says he's looking to follow up an opening win with a three-period effort against the <L>Czech Republic</L> on Saturday in <L>Pyeongchang</L> (Friday at 10:10 p.m. ET in <L>Canada</L>).

Ben Scrivens will make his second consecutive start after making 28 saves in the tournament opener.
