The aptly named Broz brothers of the <L>Czech Republic</L> are next to take to Pyeongchang's twisting ice track.
There's no sibling rivalry here; an almost telepathic understanding is required to negotiate the course without making a mistake.
As if to prove it, they're not the only brothers competing in this event. The Broz bros are joined by Andris and Juris Sics from <L>Latvia</L>.
Not forgetting the retired Andreas and Wolfgang Linger of <L>Austria</L>, who won luge doubles Olympic gold medals in 2006 and 2010 before taking silver in <L>Sochi</L>.
Continuing the trend, I'm pleased to inform you that the Moffat brothers from <L>Canada</L> have also placed highly in this event on numerous occasions.
