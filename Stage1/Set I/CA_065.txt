Hirscher raised his right index finger in the air on crossing the finish line, screaming "Yesss!" as he skied toward a television camera.

An Olympic medal in giant slalom was one of the few honours Hirscher lacked after two near misses. He placed fourth in GS at both the 2010 <L>Vancouver</L> Games and 2014 <L>Sochi</L> Games.

Hirscher is also the world champion in giant slalom, taking gold last year at <L>St. Moritz</L>, <L>Switzerland</L>.
